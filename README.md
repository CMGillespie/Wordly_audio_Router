# Wordly_audio_Router
Audio source router for wordly
as of the most current push, the code works fine in chrome and edge.  
while it also works in firefox as well, for some reason firefox does not see all the audio devices in the system.  
additionally there is an error message that comes up in firefox tellling users that the app works optimally in chrome or edge.
one dependancy/issue is the the chrome extension AudioPick prevents the routing of sources and would need to be disabled if in use.
